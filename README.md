abstract = {Abstract African swine fever (ASF) is considered the most impactful transboundary swine disease. In the absence of effective vaccines, control strategies are heavily dependent on mass depopulation and movement restrictions. Here we developed a nested multiscale model for the transmission of ASF, combining spatially explicit network model of animal movements with a deterministic compartmental model for the dynamics of two ASF strains within-pixels of 3 km Ã— 3 km, amongst the pig population in one Brazilian state. The model outcomes are epidemic duration, number of secondary infected farms and pigs, and distance of ASF spread. The model also shows the spatial distribution of ASF epidemics. We analyzed quarantine-based control interventions in the context of mortality trigger thresholds for the deployment of control strategies. The mean epidemic duration of a moderately virulent strain was 11.2 days assuming the first infection is detected (best-case scenario) and 15.9 days when detection is triggered at 10 \% mortality. For a highly virulent strain, the epidemic duration was 6.5 days and 13.1 days, respectively. The distance from the source to infected locations and the spatial distribution was not dependent on strain virulence. Under the best-case scenario, we projected an average number of infected farms of 23.77 farms and 18.8 farms for the moderate and highly virulent strains, respectively. At 10\% mortality-trigger, the predicted number of infected farms was on average 46.27 farms and 42.96 farms, respectively. We also demonstrated that the establishment of ring quarantine zones regardless of size (i.e., 5 km, 15 km) was outperformed by backward animal movement tracking. The proposed modeling framework provides an evaluation of ASF epidemic potential, providing a ranking of quarantine-based control strategies that could assist animal health authorities in planning the national preparedness and response plan.
